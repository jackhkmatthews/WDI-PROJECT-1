**needs:**

1. light up the letters as the user correctly types them
2. only allows the next character to light up if the previous one has been typed correctly.  If user falls being can reset.
3. congratulation message once the user reaches the end
4. text blocks moving from top to bottom
5. text blocks being written to the dom and then removed?

**nice to have:**

1. if user fails to complete a text block can start on the next incoming block / some intelligent logic about when the user is typing which block (number the blocks/unique starting characters
2. two genres with different song, pages and differently toned designs (light vs dark, easy vs hard)
3. speed up and slow down
4. percentage score at the end
5. sound effects for correct and incorrect key presses
6. box showing what the user has typed, i.e will have to match code exactly
